Materials:

Titanium is a very hard metal found deep in the core of the world.  It is very durable and can be used to make great armor.  It is very light, however,
and can be difficult to sharpen effectively.  Tools made from the metal are generally not very effective, although they will last a long time.

Copper has very high thermal and electrical conductivity, makeing it very useful for electical components.  The metal, however, is very soft and malleable.
It makes very poor tools and armor.
